3060	5260	Welcome to module three.
5640	12760	So now we're going to dive into actual swapping of units since we understand what's going
12760	14060	on on the live coverage sheet.
14640	22940	So let's say that we're reaching the end of this game and the producer says we need to
22940	26820	cut 30 seconds from break 11.
27260	32900	Remember the break segment 11 underneath that would be break 11.
33900	39280	So if they say we need to cut 30 seconds, immediately we know that this Jersey Mike
39280	46500	is what needs to be cut because Major League Fishing, it is sold specifically to this show,
46560	50240	even though in this ordered as column, it says sports spectacular.
50240	55720	If you look in the fine print details, it says Major League Fishing, so we cannot go
55720	59200	in any other show for the rest of the day.
60020	62700	So if one of these units got cut, it would not be good.
62780	68360	We would have to add on another commercial break or somehow fit in that 30 seconds to
68360	68980	this show.
69780	75600	So and it's very difficult to move a local and remember the producer needs to suggest
75600	76760	to cut a local.
77660	81920	So we would cut this 30 second Jersey Mike unit.
82480	87460	We would say it over the phone speaker and it would also be in emails, but we'll show
87460	89060	you how to do the emails later on.
91140	95900	So I move units, everybody on the traffic team does it a little bit differently, but
95900	100840	I like to notate next to everything as I go so that I don't get confused.
100840	107640	So we always say moved to and first we look in the ordered as column.
107800	109540	It's a sports spec unit.
110340	110800	Then.
113580	117200	We look in the.
119020	120740	Spot end time.
122560	128780	So first, we look in the ordered as it's sports spectacular and we see sports
128780	131100	spectacular units in the next show.
131260	133920	So we know that it can go there.
134540	141760	Hypothetically, it cannot go anywhere else if we needed to move it because, oh,
143080	148000	we see sports back units here, so we know we can put it in this show.
148760	152880	There are no sports back units in this show, so it cannot go here.
152880	159540	And then once again, we see sports spectacular sports spectacular units in this show,
159580	161840	so we also know that we can move it here.
161940	164440	So it's a pretty versatile unit right now.
164620	170260	There are many shows airing sports spec, so it's a good option slash your only option to cut.
171600	180620	So when something is not airing in a break, we turn it red because this signifies, OK,
180620	183620	it is not airing here.
186600	193300	And then you look in the fine print next to it, and it could either say cut if it says
193300	198440	cut next to it, and then you do no fill like that.
198820	203700	It means this break, this commercial did not air at all.
204300	205440	So we don't want that.
205500	207340	We want to make sure that we save it.
207340	211880	So let's write moved to, and we're going to move it.
212420	217840	So remember, one of the main things we're keeping track of is we need to make sure that
217840	218760	it can go in the show.
218940	220180	We look in the ordered as column.
220340	223280	It can go in the 2 p.m. show.
224600	227080	Then we look at spot end time.
227500	229840	It needs to air before 1 a.m.
230100	233540	We're good because this is just 2 p.m. this show.
234480	239240	And then we need to look at the length.
239640	241260	It's 30 seconds.
241580	244880	So we need to keep in mind brand SEP.
245180	253020	If you recall, brand SEP is the rule that a 30 second commercial cannot air within 30
253020	256080	minutes of its previously aired partner.
257000	260940	And then we look at the actual brand.
261100	262260	It's Jersey Mike.
262260	271000	So we know Jersey Mike is a restaurant unit, a restaurant company, and it is food.
271500	277100	So we want to make sure that this restaurant is not paired in another break with another
277100	277740	restaurant.
278520	279820	Well, sorry, that's so condescending.
280140	286040	We want to make sure that this that this restaurant is not paired with another restaurant.
286740	289100	So let's start our journey.
290100	299000	If it is a 30 second commercial, you have to cut 30 seconds of inventory units.
299880	308180	So we would cut you cut green, which are, remember, DRs, promos, or PSAs.
308760	312540	So I see 30 seconds right here in break one.
315860	317680	So let's see if it can go there.
317680	321740	So we have mattress.
324360	327160	There are no restaurant units here.
327160	334360	So it doesn't have any brand conflict within this break one of the 2 p.m.
334540	334840	window.
335600	337320	So let's put it here.
337320	337940	Potentially.
337940	341440	I like to make notes next to everything because I'll remember.
341720	342880	Okay, I'm looking at this one.
342880	344000	This is my top slot.
344960	351300	Now, let's make sure that it doesn't break set with anything within this 2 p.m.
351440	351760	window.
352660	357260	So there are no Jersey Mike units here.
357900	360300	There are no Jersey Mike units here.
360300	362960	And there are no Jersey Mike units here.
363140	364860	So we're good to place it here.
365580	367480	So remember, red.
368420	374200	So now remember, red means it is not airing at all.
374500	378420	This unit is 100% well, sorry.
378860	387400	Now, remember, red with the words cut next to it shows that these 2 units were cut completely.
387540	391060	They will not air at all within the day.
391220	394680	You did not save them and they are dead.
395480	398480	So that is showing that.
398940	406360	Now, we are going to show that we moved this Jersey Mike unit to break one.
406940	408680	So we press here.
409160	410580	We insert a line.
411140	415100	It doesn't really matter where in the break you put this line.
415200	419440	You could put it there or you could put it at the bottom.
420620	421300	Insert.
422940	425480	Or you could put it at the very bottom.
425800	434080	So I right click, insert line, and then you copy and you paste it in that line.
435020	437800	Now, we let's finish up up here.
438140	450260	So moved to you write B one, which B stands for break of the 2 p.m. of the 2 p.m. window.
451220	462740	So then we right here moved from the 11 of the let's see what game this is.
462740	471740	It started at 12 p.m. of the 12 p.m. show or game.
472380	478420	And now if you're looking at this, you can see here, okay, this unit at first glance might be,
478600	479740	oh, no, is this unit cut?
479740	481400	No, we look next to it.
481400	482220	We see this comment.
482220	482580	All right.
482580	485740	It's moved to be one of the 2 p.m.
486120	486520	Okay.
486780	487920	So we go to 2 p.m.
488040	488340	All right.
488340	490580	This is the correct amount of time cut.
490680	494160	If you cut 30 seconds, you can add in 30 seconds.
494680	497460	But oh, no, this what does this mean?
497660	498720	It's still red.
499000	501380	So now we turn it blue.
501920	507420	So now we turn it blue, which shows, oh, okay.
507420	510380	Blue means I aired in this break.
512000	513580	There we go.
513880	519640	Red means it did not air or it was cut because see here it's red.
519860	523400	It did not air, but it wasn't cut because we have this comment here.
523800	527720	Then here it's red, but it is cut completely dead.
527820	529660	These units will never air.
530020	535400	And then in its place of this 30 second is this 30 second Jersey Mike commercial.
535960	539080	So remember, we look at the ordered as column.
539520	545320	We make sure that this 2 p.m. game allows sports spec units.
545900	547340	Then we look at the time.
547880	554140	We make sure that the spot end time it's airing before it's spot end time.
554720	559380	Then we look at the length of the commercial to make sure.
559380	562900	Remember to make sure that we're following brand SEP.
563700	573900	And then we look at the title, which gives us the details about the advertiser
573900	579340	so that we make sure we're not violating brand SEP.
579980	584380	And that is how we move a unit on the live coverage sheet.
585240	591480	Now, there is a way that we write this down for master control
591480	594760	because all of this is sent via email.
595620	598460	And I will show you how to notate it right now.
