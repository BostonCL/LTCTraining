00:03.060 --> 00:05.260
Welcome to module three.

00:05.640 --> 00:12.760
So now we're going to dive into actual swapping of units since we understand what's going

00:12.760 --> 00:14.060
on on the live coverage sheet.

00:14.640 --> 00:22.940
So let's say that we're reaching the end of this game and the producer says we need to

00:22.940 --> 00:26.820
cut 30 seconds from break 11.

00:27.260 --> 00:32.900
Remember the break segment 11 underneath that would be break 11.

00:33.900 --> 00:39.280
So if they say we need to cut 30 seconds, immediately we know that this Jersey Mike

00:39.280 --> 00:46.500
is what needs to be cut because Major League Fishing, it is sold specifically to this show,

00:46.560 --> 00:50.240
even though in this ordered as column, it says sports spectacular.

00:50.240 --> 00:55.720
If you look in the fine print details, it says Major League Fishing, so we cannot go

00:55.720 --> 00:59.200
in any other show for the rest of the day.

01:00.020 --> 01:02.700
So if one of these units got cut, it would not be good.

01:02.780 --> 01:08.360
We would have to add on another commercial break or somehow fit in that 30 seconds to

01:08.360 --> 01:08.980
this show.

01:09.780 --> 01:15.600
So and it's very difficult to move a local and remember the producer needs to suggest

01:15.600 --> 01:16.760
to cut a local.

01:17.660 --> 01:21.920
So we would cut this 30 second Jersey Mike unit.

01:22.480 --> 01:27.460
We would say it over the phone speaker and it would also be in emails, but we'll show

01:27.460 --> 01:29.060
you how to do the emails later on.

01:31.140 --> 01:35.900
So I move units, everybody on the traffic team does it a little bit differently, but

01:35.900 --> 01:40.840
I like to notate next to everything as I go so that I don't get confused.

01:40.840 --> 01:47.640
So we always say moved to and first we look in the ordered as column.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.540
It's a sports spec unit.

01:50.340 --> 01:50.800
Then.

01:53.580 --> 01:57.200
We look in the.

01:59.020 --> 02:00.740
Spot end time.

02:02.560 --> 02:08.780
So first, we look in the ordered as it's sports spectacular and we see sports

02:08.780 --> 02:11.100
spectacular units in the next show.

02:11.260 --> 02:13.920
So we know that it can go there.

02:14.540 --> 02:21.760
Hypothetically, it cannot go anywhere else if we needed to move it because, oh,

02:23.080 --> 02:28.000
we see sports back units here, so we know we can put it in this show.

02:28.760 --> 02:32.880
There are no sports back units in this show, so it cannot go here.

02:32.880 --> 02:39.540
And then once again, we see sports spectacular sports spectacular units in this show,

02:39.580 --> 02:41.840
so we also know that we can move it here.

02:41.940 --> 02:44.440
So it's a pretty versatile unit right now.

02:44.620 --> 02:50.260
There are many shows airing sports spec, so it's a good option slash your only option to cut.

02:51.600 --> 03:00.620
So when something is not airing in a break, we turn it red because this signifies, OK,

03:00.620 --> 03:03.620
it is not airing here.

03:06.600 --> 03:13.300
And then you look in the fine print next to it, and it could either say cut if it says

03:13.300 --> 03:18.440
cut next to it, and then you do no fill like that.

03:18.820 --> 03:23.700
It means this break, this commercial did not air at all.

03:24.300 --> 03:25.440
So we don't want that.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.340
We want to make sure that we save it.

03:27.340 --> 03:31.880
So let's write moved to, and we're going to move it.

03:32.420 --> 03:37.840
So remember, one of the main things we're keeping track of is we need to make sure that

03:37.840 --> 03:38.760
it can go in the show.

03:38.940 --> 03:40.180
We look in the ordered as column.

03:40.340 --> 03:43.280
It can go in the 2 p.m. show.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.080
Then we look at spot end time.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.840
It needs to air before 1 a.m.

03:50.100 --> 03:53.540
We're good because this is just 2 p.m. this show.

03:54.480 --> 03:59.240
And then we need to look at the length.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.260
It's 30 seconds.

04:01.580 --> 04:04.880
So we need to keep in mind brand SEP.

04:05.180 --> 04:13.020
If you recall, brand SEP is the rule that a 30 second commercial cannot air within 30

04:13.020 --> 04:16.080
minutes of its previously aired partner.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.940
And then we look at the actual brand.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.260
It's Jersey Mike.

04:22.260 --> 04:31.000
So we know Jersey Mike is a restaurant unit, a restaurant company, and it is food.

04:31.500 --> 04:37.100
So we want to make sure that this restaurant is not paired in another break with another

04:37.100 --> 04:37.740
restaurant.

04:38.520 --> 04:39.820
Well, sorry, that's so condescending.

04:40.140 --> 04:46.040
We want to make sure that this that this restaurant is not paired with another restaurant.

04:46.740 --> 04:49.100
So let's start our journey.

04:50.100 --> 04:59.000
If it is a 30 second commercial, you have to cut 30 seconds of inventory units.

04:59.880 --> 05:08.180
So we would cut you cut green, which are, remember, DRs, promos, or PSAs.

05:08.760 --> 05:12.540
So I see 30 seconds right here in break one.

05:15.860 --> 05:17.680
So let's see if it can go there.

05:17.680 --> 05:21.740
So we have mattress.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.160
There are no restaurant units here.

05:27.160 --> 05:34.360
So it doesn't have any brand conflict within this break one of the 2 p.m.

05:34.540 --> 05:34.840
window.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.320
So let's put it here.

05:37.320 --> 05:37.940
Potentially.

05:37.940 --> 05:41.440
I like to make notes next to everything because I'll remember.

05:41.720 --> 05:42.880
Okay, I'm looking at this one.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.000
This is my top slot.

05:44.880 --> 05:51.300
Now, let's make sure that it doesn't break set with anything within this 2 p.m.

05:51.440 --> 05:51.760
window.

05:52.660 --> 05:57.260
So there are no Jersey Mike units here.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.300
There are no Jersey Mike units here.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.960
And there are no Jersey Mike units here.

06:03.140 --> 06:04.860
So we're good to place it here.

06:05.580 --> 06:07.480
So remember, red.

06:08.420 --> 06:14.200
So now remember, red means it is not airing at all.

06:14.500 --> 06:18.420
This unit is 100% well, sorry.

06:18.860 --> 06:27.400
Now, remember, red with the words cut next to it shows that these 2 units were cut completely.

06:27.540 --> 06:31.060
They will not air at all within the day.

06:31.220 --> 06:34.680
You did not save them and they are dead.

06:35.480 --> 06:38.480
So that is showing that.

06:38.940 --> 06:46.360
Now, we are going to show that we moved this Jersey Mike unit to break one.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.680
So we press here.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.580
We insert a line.

06:51.140 --> 06:55.100
It doesn't really matter where in the break you put this line.

06:55.200 --> 06:59.440
You could put it there or you could put it at the bottom.

07:00.620 --> 07:01.300
Insert.

07:02.940 --> 07:05.480
Or you could put it at the very bottom.

07:05.800 --> 07:14.080
So I right click, insert line, and then you copy and you paste it in that line.

07:15.020 --> 07:17.800
Now, we let's finish up up here.

07:18.140 --> 07:30.260
So moved to you write B one, which B stands for break of the 2 p.m. of the 2 p.m. window.

07:31.120 --> 07:42.740
So then we right here moved from the 11 of the let's see what game this is.

07:42.740 --> 07:51.740
It started at 12 p.m. of the 12 p.m. show or game.

07:52.380 --> 07:58.420
And now if you're looking at this, you can see here, okay, this unit at first glance might be,

07:58.600 --> 07:59.740
oh, no, is this unit cut?

07:59.740 --> 08:01.400
No, we look next to it.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.220
We see this comment.

08:02.220 --> 08:02.580
All right.

08:02.580 --> 08:05.740
It's moved to be one of the 2 p.m.

08:06.120 --> 08:06.520
Okay.

08:06.780 --> 08:07.920
So we go to 2 p.m.

08:08.040 --> 08:08.340
All right.

08:08.340 --> 08:10.580
This is the correct amount of time cut.

08:10.680 --> 08:14.160
If you cut 30 seconds, you can add in 30 seconds.

08:14.680 --> 08:17.460
But oh, no, this what does this mean?

08:17.660 --> 08:18.720
It's still red.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.380
So now we turn it blue.

08:21.920 --> 08:27.420
So now we turn it blue, which shows, oh, okay.

08:27.420 --> 08:30.520
Blue means I aired in this break.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.580
There we go.

08:33.880 --> 08:39.640
Red means it did not air or it was cut because see here it's red.

08:39.860 --> 08:43.400
It did not air, but it wasn't cut because we have this comment here.

08:43.800 --> 08:47.720
Then here it's red, but it is cut completely dead.

08:47.820 --> 08:49.660
These units will never air.

08:50.020 --> 08:55.400
And then in its place of this 30 second is this 30 second Jersey Mike commercial.

08:55.940 --> 08:59.080
So remember, we look at the ordered as column.

08:59.520 --> 09:05.320
We make sure that this 2 p.m. game allows sports spec units.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.340
Then we look at the time.

09:07.880 --> 09:14.140
We make sure that the spot end time it's airing before it's spot end time.

09:14.720 --> 09:19.380
Then we look at the length of the commercial to make sure.

09:19.380 --> 09:22.900
Remember to make sure that we're following brand SEP.

09:23.640 --> 09:33.900
And then we look at the title, which gives us the details about the advertiser

09:33.900 --> 09:39.340
so that we make sure we're not violating brand SEP.

09:39.980 --> 09:44.380
And that is how we move a unit on the live coverage sheet.

09:45.240 --> 09:51.480
Now, there is a way that we write this down for master control

09:51.480 --> 09:54.760
because all of this is sent via email.

09:55.620 --> 09:58.460
And I will show you how to notate it right now.
