# --- Main Introduction ---
intro_01|Hello and welcome! Our job in the Traffic Department at CBS Sports Network is to represent Advertisers and ensure that their Commercials make it to air. Covering live traffic means you will be monitoring commercial inventory in real time while ensuring that airing criteria and network guidelines are met. In other words, you will be watching different sporting events and making sure the commercials are shown on television according to a specific set of rules. Don't worry! We will learn all about Commercials and the rules for airing them in the course.
intro_02|Before we begin, here are a few basic terms to familiarize yourself with:
intro_03|Advertiser: An individual or organization that promotes products, services, or ideas to a target audience.
intro_04|Commercial: A short advertisement that promotes a product or service.
intro_05|Unit: Another word for Commercial. These terms are used interchangeably in the Traffic Department.
intro_06|Commercial Breaks: The planned intervals during which advertisements are aired.
intro_07|Window: A term used in the Traffic Department for any particular program or game. Window refers specifically to the time period during which the program or game airs, encompassing the duration from its beginning to its end. For example, instead of saying "7 PM Basketball Game," we would say "7 PM Window."
intro_08|Live Coverage Sheet: An excel spreadsheet containing all the vital information you will need in order to properly air Commercials/Units.
intro_09|Swaps: The word for making changes on the live coverage sheet. It typically involves saving or updating a commercial unit. This process includes modifying the placement of commercials during live broadcasts to align with the timing or logistics, to ensure accurate tracking and smooth execution of the broadcast. Essentially, swaps are quick adjustments made in real-time to the coverage sheet to manage commercial placements effectively.
intro_10|Dead: A term used in the Traffic Department to indicate that a Commercial/Unit will not air at all that day or night.
intro_11|Cut is a term used when a Commercial/Unit has been removed from its original spot. A Cut Commercial/Unit may still air in another show or time slot. Note: While 'Dead' and 'Cut' are sometimes used interchangeably, they do not mean exactly the same thing. A dead unit never airs, while a cut unit might.
intro_12|What is live coverage? Live coverage involves three main responsibilities: Managing and airing all Commercials/Units during live games. Communicating with the network producer and Master Control through phone and email. We will refer to Master Control as MC from here on. They are the people that ultimately send the commercials to air. We communicate with them the most. So be nice to them! And marking down airing times. Effectively managing inventory is crucial for the financial and overall success of CBS Sports Network. The network operates on a 24-hour clock from 6 AM to 6 AM, so our goal is to schedule and properly organize the Commercials within that 24-hour period! Beware! There are many factors that contribute to the ever changing schedules of live coverage. A program can go longer than anticipated. As a result, Units can be cut. Our job is to advocate for Commercials/Units and ensure that they air on TV despite these changes. The role may appear intimidating at first, but don't worry. This training course will set you up for success in the CBS Traffic Department. Keep in mind there will be practice questions throughout the course, and there will be a test at the end. You must score 70% or higher on the test to proceed.
intro_13|Participants must take notes and prepare questions for a follow-up appointment with the Traffic Team.

# --- Module 1 ---
module-1/01-intro/module1_intro|Welcome to module 1! Now, let's begin!
module-1/01-intro/module1_01|This is an example of a Live Coverage Sheet. Before each shift, you will receive an email containing a Live Coverage Sheet. This spreadsheet tells us when specific Commercials will air. It is separated by columns that we will break down later on in this module.
module-1/01-intro/module1_02|Pause here for a moment so that you can take it all in...
module-1/01-intro/module1_03|Thoroughly understanding the Live Coverage Sheet is crucial to ensuring that you can effectively manage Unit placement during live games, where adjustments are often necessary due to Unit cuts. Each column contains critical information that determines whether a Unit can or cannot be assigned to a specific place on the Live Coverage Sheet.
module-1/01-intro/module1_04|Let's start at the Program line
module1_realtime|First, let's talk about the Real Time field. This indicates if the data is live or delayed.
main_introduction|Welcome to the CBS Live Traffic Coverage Training program. Use the menu on the left to navigate through the modules.
module1_starttimerealtime_00.mp3|This is the start of the Real Time & Start Time section.
module1_starttimerealtime_01.mp3|Here we will discuss Real Time and Start Time:
module1_starttimerealtime_02.mp3|Real Time: Real Time is the scheduled time that the game or show is supposed to begin.
module1_starttimerealtime_03.mp3|Start Time: Start Time is the actual time the game or show begins.
module1_starttimerealtime_04.mp3|For example: If a show or game is scheduled to begin at 8AM, that is the Real Time. So, you write down 8:00:00 next to Real Time regardless of when it actually begins.
module1_starttimerealtime_05.mp3|But for Start Time, let's say the game is delayed and starts at 8:03:30 AM. You would write 8:03:30 AM down next to Start Time.
module1_starttimerealtime_06.mp3|This is how the Real Time/ Start Time column would appear in this example: 
module-1/program-line/module1_programline_01|The Program line is the gray line that appears before and after each commercial break.
module-1/program-line/module1_programline_02|The main details to focus on are, show title and segment number. In this case the show title is "That Other Pregame Show" and the segment number is circled in red. The segment number represents which commercial break you're about to enter and is always listed directly above that break.
module-1/program-line/module1_programline_03|For example, if you're making swaps right below the 'SEG 2' program line, you're working in Break 2.

# --- Key Tab ---
module-1/keytab/keytab_01|In the bottom left-hand corner of this Excel file, you'll see two tabs: 'Key' and 'Coverage.' All that we have discussed so far is found in the Coverage tab. You'll spend most of your time working in the Coverage tab, but occasionally you'll need to refer to the Key tab. Keep in mind that some information on the Key tab is outdated, so focus only on the important information explained here.
module-1/keytab/keytab_02|Contingency Plan: This plan outlines what to do if a game runs long â€” for example, which shows might be cut or adjusted.
module-1/keytab/keytab_03|Live Coverage Reports: At the end of your shift, you will send out a Live Coverage Report. The list of email recipients is listed below the Live Coverage Reports section.
module-1/keytab/keytab_04|One more thing to note: at the top of the sheet, you'll see a color code. The important colors to remember are: Yellow (Commercial), Red (CUT), Blue (Moved From). There will be more information about these color codes and their significance in Module 3.

# --- Hit Time ---
module-1/03-hit-time/module1_hittime_single|Right next door is the Hit Time column, this will determine a Mock Schedule. We use Mock Schedules for planning placement of Commercials. Hit Times are not the actual times that commercials air, just estimated placeholders. This column is very important when moving Units around because of a rule called 'Brand SEP.' Brand SEP will be discussed further in Module 3.
