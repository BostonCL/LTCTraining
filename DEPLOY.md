# ðŸš€ Ready to Deploy!

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

âœ… Build passing (verified)  
âœ… All assets migrated to R2  
âœ… 32 components updated  
âœ… No linter errors  
âœ… Security: credentials excluded from git  

## Deploy Now

### Option 1: Deploy via Git (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Stage all changes
git add .

# 2. Commit the R2 migration
git commit -m "Migrate to Cloudflare R2 CDN for all video/audio assets"

# 3. Push to GitHub (triggers Vercel auto-deploy)
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically detect the push and deploy! ðŸŽ‰

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI

```bash
# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## Post-Deployment

1. **Test the live site** - Verify videos load from R2
2. **Monitor R2 usage** - Check Cloudflare dashboard
3. **(Optional)** Remove large video files from Git after confirming everything works

## What Changed

- All asset URLs now point to R2 CDN
- No more local video serving
- Repo will deploy successfully (no size limits)
- Better performance via global CDN

## Expected Results

âœ… Fast deployment (no large files)  
âœ… Videos load from: `https://pub-aca3ec806e844324a6218bb0d8bf7295.r2.dev`  
âœ… Scalable and cost-effective  
âœ… Global CDN distribution
