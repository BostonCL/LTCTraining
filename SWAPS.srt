1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,260
Welcome to module three.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,760
So now we're going to dive into actual swapping of units since we understand what's going

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,060
on on the live coverage sheet.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:22,940
So let's say that we're reaching the end of this game and the producer says we need to

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,820
cut 30 seconds from break 11.

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,900
Remember the break segment 11 underneath that would be break 11.

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,280
So if they say we need to cut 30 seconds, immediately we know that this Jersey Mike

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,500
is what needs to be cut because Major League Fishing, it is sold specifically to this show,

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,240
even though in this ordered as column, it says sports spectacular.

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,720
If you look in the fine print details, it says Major League Fishing, so we cannot go

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,200
in any other show for the rest of the day.

12
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,700
So if one of these units got cut, it would not be good.

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,360
We would have to add on another commercial break or somehow fit in that 30 seconds to

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:08,980
this show.

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,600
So and it's very difficult to move a local and remember the producer needs to suggest

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,760
to cut a local.

17
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,920
So we would cut this 30 second Jersey Mike unit.

18
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,460
We would say it over the phone speaker and it would also be in emails, but we'll show

19
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,060
you how to do the emails later on.

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,900
So I move units, everybody on the traffic team does it a little bit differently, but

21
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,840
I like to notate next to everything as I go so that I don't get confused.

22
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:47,640
So we always say moved to and first we look in the ordered as column.

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,540
It's a sports spec unit.

24
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:50,800
Then.

25
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,200
We look in the.

26
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,740
Spot end time.

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,780
So first, we look in the ordered as it's sports spectacular and we see sports

28
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,100
spectacular units in the next show.

29
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,920
So we know that it can go there.

30
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:21,760
Hypothetically, it cannot go anywhere else if we needed to move it because, oh,

31
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,000
we see sports back units here, so we know we can put it in this show.

32
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,880
There are no sports back units in this show, so it cannot go here.

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,540
And then once again, we see sports spectacular sports spectacular units in this show,

34
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,840
so we also know that we can move it here.

35
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,440
So it's a pretty versatile unit right now.

36
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,260
There are many shows airing sports spec, so it's a good option slash your only option to cut.

37
00:02:51,600 --> 00:03:00,620
So when something is not airing in a break, we turn it red because this signifies, OK,

38
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,620
it is not airing here.

39
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:13,300
And then you look in the fine print next to it, and it could either say cut if it says

40
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,440
cut next to it, and then you do no fill like that.

41
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,700
It means this break, this commercial did not air at all.

42
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,440
So we don't want that.

43
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,340
We want to make sure that we save it.

44
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,880
So let's write moved to, and we're going to move it.

45
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,840
So remember, one of the main things we're keeping track of is we need to make sure that

46
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,760
it can go in the show.

47
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,180
We look in the ordered as column.

48
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,280
It can go in the 2 p.m. show.

49
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,080
Then we look at spot end time.

50
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,840
It needs to air before 1 a.m.

51
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,540
We're good because this is just 2 p.m. this show.

52
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,240
And then we need to look at the length.

53
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,260
It's 30 seconds.

54
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,880
So we need to keep in mind brand SEP.

55
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:13,020
If you recall, brand SEP is the rule that a 30 second commercial cannot air within 30

56
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,080
minutes of its previously aired partner.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,940
And then we look at the actual brand.

58
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,260
It's Jersey Mike.

59
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:31,000
So we know Jersey Mike is a restaurant unit, a restaurant company, and it is food.

60
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,100
So we want to make sure that this restaurant is not paired in another break with another

61
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,740
restaurant.

62
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,820
Well, sorry, that's so condescending.

63
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:46,040
We want to make sure that this that this restaurant is not paired with another restaurant.

64
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,100
So let's start our journey.

65
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:59,000
If it is a 30 second commercial, you have to cut 30 seconds of inventory units.

66
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:08,180
So we would cut you cut green, which are, remember, DRs, promos, or PSAs.

67
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,540
So I see 30 seconds right here in break one.

68
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,680
So let's see if it can go there.

69
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,740
So we have mattress.

70
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,160
There are no restaurant units here.

71
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:34,360
So it doesn't have any brand conflict within this break one of the 2 p.m.

72
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:34,840
window.

73
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,320
So let's put it here.

74
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,940
Potentially.

75
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,440
I like to make notes next to everything because I'll remember.

76
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,880
Okay, I'm looking at this one.

77
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,000
This is my top slot.

78
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,300
Now, let's make sure that it doesn't break set with anything within this 2 p.m.

79
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:51,760
window.

80
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,260
So there are no Jersey Mike units here.

81
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,300
There are no Jersey Mike units here.

82
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,960
And there are no Jersey Mike units here.

83
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,860
So we're good to place it here.

84
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,480
So remember, red.

85
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:14,200
So now remember, red means it is not airing at all.

86
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,420
This unit is 100% well, sorry.

87
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:27,400
Now, remember, red with the words cut next to it shows that these 2 units were cut completely.

88
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,060
They will not air at all within the day.

89
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,680
You did not save them and they are dead.

90
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,480
So that is showing that.

91
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:46,360
Now, we are going to show that we moved this Jersey Mike unit to break one.

92
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,680
So we press here.

93
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,580
We insert a line.

94
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,100
It doesn't really matter where in the break you put this line.

95
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,440
You could put it there or you could put it at the bottom.

96
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,300
Insert.

97
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,480
Or you could put it at the very bottom.

98
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:14,080
So I right click, insert line, and then you copy and you paste it in that line.

99
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,800
Now, we let's finish up up here.

100
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:30,260
So moved to you write B one, which B stands for break of the 2 p.m. of the 2 p.m. window.

101
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:42,740
So then we right here moved from the 11 of the let's see what game this is.

102
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:51,740
It started at 12 p.m. of the 12 p.m. show or game.

103
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:58,420
And now if you're looking at this, you can see here, okay, this unit at first glance might be,

104
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,740
oh, no, is this unit cut?

105
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,400
No, we look next to it.

106
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,220
We see this comment.

107
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:02,580
All right.

108
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,740
It's moved to be one of the 2 p.m.

109
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,520
Okay.

110
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,920
So we go to 2 p.m.

111
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,340
All right.

112
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,580
This is the correct amount of time cut.

113
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,160
If you cut 30 seconds, you can add in 30 seconds.

114
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,460
But oh, no, this what does this mean?

115
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,720
It's still red.

116
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,380
So now we turn it blue.

117
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,420
So now we turn it blue, which shows, oh, okay.

118
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,520
Blue means I aired in this break.

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,580
There we go.

120
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,640
Red means it did not air or it was cut because see here it's red.

121
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,400
It did not air, but it wasn't cut because we have this comment here.

122
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,720
Then here it's red, but it is cut completely dead.

123
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,660
These units will never air.

124
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:55,400
And then in its place of this 30 second is this 30 second Jersey Mike commercial.

125
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,080
So remember, we look at the ordered as column.

126
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:05,320
We make sure that this 2 p.m. game allows sports spec units.

127
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,340
Then we look at the time.

128
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,140
We make sure that the spot end time it's airing before it's spot end time.

129
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,380
Then we look at the length of the commercial to make sure.

130
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,900
Remember to make sure that we're following brand SEP.

131
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:33,900
And then we look at the title, which gives us the details about the advertiser

132
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:39,340
so that we make sure we're not violating brand SEP.

133
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,380
And that is how we move a unit on the live coverage sheet.

134
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,480
Now, there is a way that we write this down for master control

135
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,760
because all of this is sent via email.

136
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,460
And I will show you how to notate it right now.
