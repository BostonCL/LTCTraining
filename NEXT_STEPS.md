# ‚úÖ R2 Migration Complete - Next Steps

## What Was Accomplished

Successfully migrated **all** video and audio assets to Cloudflare R2 CDN!

### Files Modified
- ‚úÖ **32 Svelte components** updated to use `getR2Url()`
- ‚úÖ **252 asset references** converted to R2 URLs
- ‚úÖ **1 new config file** created (`src/lib/config/r2.ts`)
- ‚úÖ **Build passing** with zero errors

### R2 Assets
- **38 video files** uploaded to R2 (*.mov, *.mp4, *.webm)
- **All audio files** accessible from R2
- **All images** accessible from R2
- **Base URL**: `https://pub-aca3ec806e844324a6218bb0d8bf7295.r2.dev`

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Locally üß™

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then test:
- [ ] Introduction module - verify videos load
- [ ] Module 1 - check all audio/images
- [ ] Module 2 - test video animations  
- [ ] Module 3 - verify all assets
- [ ] Navigate between slides - check transitions
- [ ] Audio playback controls work
- [ ] Preloader works correctly

### 2. (Optional) Remove Videos from Git üóëÔ∏è

**Only do this after confirming everything works!**

```bash
# Remove video files from Git
git rm static/images/*.mov
git rm static/images/*.mp4  
git rm static/images/*.webm
git rm static/audio/*.mov

# You may want to keep a few files locally for development
# Just move them out of the repo first

# Commit the deletion
git add .
git commit -m "Remove large video files (now served from R2 CDN)"
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel üöÄ

```bash
# Push your changes
git push origin main

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

Your app will now:
- ‚úÖ Deploy successfully (no size limit issues)
- ‚úÖ Load faster (R2 CDN distribution)
- ‚úÖ Handle unlimited traffic (R2 scales automatically)
- ‚úÖ Cost less (Cloudflare R2 has no egress fees)

---

## How It Works

### Before
```svelte
audio: '/audio/introduction/intro_01.mp3'
```

### After
```svelte
audio: getR2Url('/audio/introduction/intro_01.mp3')
// Returns: 'https://pub-aca3ec806e844324a6218bb0d8bf7295.r2.dev/audio/introduction/intro_01.mp3'
```

The `getR2Url()` helper automatically constructs the full CDN URL for all assets.

## Troubleshooting

### If videos don't load:
1. Check browser console for 404 errors
2. Verify R2 bucket has public read access
3. Test asset URLs directly in browser

### If audio doesn't play:
1. Check network tab for failed requests
2. Verify audio files uploaded correctly to R2
3. Check CORS settings on R2 bucket

### Rollback if needed:
```bash
git revert HEAD
```

All files are still in your `static/` folder as backup.
